# Market Basket Analysis with PySpark

## Overview

This repository contains code and resources for performing Market Basket Analysis (MBA) using PySpark. Market Basket Analysis is a technique used by retailers to discover associations between products that customers tend to purchase together. This analysis can provide valuable insights for product placement, inventory management, and targeted marketing strategies.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Apache Spark: You need to have Apache Spark installed and configured on your system. You can download it from the [Apache Spark website](https://spark.apache.org/).

- PySpark: PySpark is the Python library for Spark. You can install it using `pip`:
  ```
  pip install pyspark
  ```

- Dataset: You'll need a transaction dataset (e.g., a CSV file) containing the purchase history of customers.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/market-basket-analysis-pyspark.git
   ```

2. Create a directory for your dataset:

   ```
   mkdir data
   ```

3. Place your dataset file (e.g., `transactions.csv`) in the `data` directory.

4. Launch a PySpark session:

   ```
   pyspark
   ```

5. Run the Market Basket Analysis script:

   ```
   from market_basket_analysis import market_basket_analysis

   # Load your dataset
   transactions = spark.read.csv("data/transactions.csv", header=True, inferSchema=True)

   # Perform Market Basket Analysis
   results = market_basket_analysis(transactions)

   # Display the results
   results.show()
   ```

6. Customize the analysis parameters and post-processing based on your specific requirements.

## Project Structure

- `market_basket_analysis.py`: Contains the code for performing Market Basket Analysis.
- `data/`: Directory for storing your dataset.
- `README.md`: This documentation.

## Customization

You can customize the Market Basket Analysis parameters, such as support, confidence, and lift thresholds, in the `market_basket_analysis.py` script. Adjust these values according to your analysis goals.

## Results

The analysis will provide insights into item associations, including support, confidence, and lift measures. You can further analyze and interpret these results to make data-driven decisions for your business.
